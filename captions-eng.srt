1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,520
Praise be to God, and I bear witness that there is no god but God alone.

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:09,040
He has no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:13,639
May God bless him and grant him peace. Welcome.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:18,000
Welcome to the first meeting of the new series

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:23,400
The new series of contemplation and the new course

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,840
It is a series that I learned from Joseph, peace be upon him.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,080
We call it the management of Surah Yusuf, peace be upon him and his family.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,279
Our Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,440
We ask God to open up good things for us

10
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:37,480
And may He guide us to all good things.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:42,360
May God accept good deeds from us and you.

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:45,239
And to help us to understand this

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,640
الصوره الحقيقه هو يعني الكلام مش مش

14
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:51,480
Exaggeration makes a person feel very burdened, meaning burden

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:57,399
It is really big and it is inside the picture because it is

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:01:02,879
Not like any picture, God described it in the best stories

17
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:06,160
The subject requires a lot of effort from us, sorry

18
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,160
In the name of God

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,560
The subject takes a lot of effort from us.

20
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:29,799
We ask God for success and facilitation

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,799
And may God grant success. Amen, God willing. Amen.

22
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,720
All

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,799
As usual

24
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,399
Which Surah do we start with?

25
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:52,880
الاول بنستفتح بالقراءه عشان ناخد بركه

26
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:56,360
Read the Quran and then we sit and chat.

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,560
The meanings and aesthetics of the Surah

28
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,759
Surah

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,759
Joseph, peace be upon him, and this is the first meeting

30
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:04,759
Let's start reading first

31
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:11,920
We seek help from God Almighty

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:15,720
Let's start with the beneficial effects.

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:19,879
We will read, God willing

34
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,120
I think today we can take from the verse

35
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:25,840
one

36
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:29,239
To verse six, only six verses we will live with in

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,239
First meeting

38
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,160
I seek refuge in God from Satan the accursed

39
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,680
In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful

40
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,840
pain

41
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,840
These are the verses of the clear Book.

42
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,920
I

43
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:10,120
Anzalnah

44
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:10,120
Our Qur’an is in Arabic so that you may understand.

45
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:22,120
We relate to you the best of stories in what We have revealed to you.

46
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:29,720
Here is the Quran

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:38,599
And if you were before that among the heedless

48
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:40,200
When Joseph said to his father, “O my father, indeed I have seen someone

49
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,519
planet

50
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:50,680
The sun and the moon

51
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:52,840
And the sun and the moon, I showed them prostrating to me.

52
00:03:50,680 --> 00:04:02,040
He said, my son

53
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:06,200
Do not tell your brothers about your dream, lest they plot against you.

54
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:09,879
The devil is for man

55
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:14,959
A clear enemy

56
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:19,799
And thus your Lord chooses you and teaches you

57
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:25,360
From the interpretation of hadiths

58
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:30,080
May His blessings and mercy be upon you and upon

59
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,080
Al Jacob as

60
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,720
Atoms

61
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:38,080
on

62
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,720
Your parents before Abraham

63
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,199
Wassaq

64
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,199
These

65
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,199
Your Lord is All-Knowing and All-Wise

66
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:58,800
Surah Yusuf, peace be upon him, the truth about man

67
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:01,080
He is advancing, meaning between these pictures, with all awe.

68
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,560
You deserve it

69
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,800
Surah Yusuf, peace be upon him

70
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:10,840
Let's get to know the surah. First, it is a Meccan surah.

71
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,680
The Makki Surah is not the same as the other one.

72
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,120
Surah Makkih

73
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,440
It was revealed to the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and God

74
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:25,080
Come on, I know, in the most difficult period of the Meccan decade

75
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:30,319
All of it is the period that was between

76
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,880
The death of Khadija and the death of Abu Talib and the pledge of allegiance at Aqaba

77
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:36,199
First

78
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:39,919
وهي الفتره اللي هي عام الحزن من عام

79
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:42,440
Sadness until we reach the first obstacle

80
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,960
This is the most difficult period that the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, has gone through.

81
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,000
Peace be upon you

82
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:50,039
And behind it are very, very severe trials.

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,120
ابتلاقات كانت زادت قوي طبعا كان ده

84
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:56,280
Shortly before that, the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace,

85
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:00,039
Peace be upon you from the people of Abu Talib and the people of Abu

86
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:03,479
طالب اللي هجروا فيه اخواته اللي هجروا

87
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:09,360
فيه اعمامه اللي هجروا فيه يعني الناس

88
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:11,639
اللي منه تمام اقاربه ما من قريش وكان

89
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,240
نزلت سوره يوسف عشان تقول له لو كان

90
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:21,400
Your brothers from Quraish did this to you and made you enter a tribe

91
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:24,440
Abu Talib and his brother Yusuf worked in 1 A 3 and it was

92
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:28,680
Surah Yusuf is a consolation for the heart of the Prophet, peace be upon him

93
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:33,039
والسلام وبتقول له نهايه يوسف عليه السلام

94
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:36,759
It was empowerment and his sisters repented in the end

95
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:40,440
وانصلح حالهم وكان دي كانت بشاره للنبي

96
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:44,319
عليه الصلاه والسلام ان نهايه الابتلاء ده

97
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,160
Enable in the end and one can not even

98
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:52,280
He is afflicted

99
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:54,800
ونهايه الالم ده يعني سعه وسرور وفرج من

100
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,319
God Almighty

101
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,160
وبشار ليه ان زي ما اخوات يوسف يعني يعني

102
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,560
تابوا في النهايه فالله سبحانه وتعالى

103
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:08,319
يبشره ان اللي عمل فيك كده في شعب ابي

104
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:12,120
Student, God willing

105
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:16,520
يتوبوا وينصلح حالهم وده اللي حصل بالفعل

106
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,479
After the conquest of Mecca, this means just getting to know

107
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,160
The beautiful Surah

108
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:25,240
Surah Yusuf, peace be upon him

109
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:27,280
It is said that the reason for its revelation is that

110
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,479
The companions, may God be pleased with them, said:

111
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,400
To the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, meaning they were

112
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:37,360
They were bored and wanted some stories. They said, “Oh…”

113
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:40,919
Messenger of God, did you tell us stories? I mean, if there is none

114
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,960
كده مواعظ جوه قصص يعني ايه وده يدل على

115
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:47,360
The importance of stories in preaching. The Companions themselves, may God be pleased with them.

116
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:52,199
الله عنهم وارضاهم طلبوا من النبي عليه

117
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:55,599
Peace and blessings mean that he tells many stories because of his strength.

118
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:59,599
The effect of the story on the heart and soul, so he said, O Messenger of God

119
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:04,639
God, why don’t you tell us about it? Then He revealed His words, “We”

120
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:07,800
We relate to you the best of stories, and Surah Yusuf was revealed to him.

121
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:11,280
Peace be upon the hearts of the companions and the Prophet, peace be upon him.

122
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,400
Peace and blessings for the tremendous impact of the story on

123
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,599
النفس وقوه الوعظ اللي بيبقى دايما في

124
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,159
The story is that it provides a practical model all the time.

125
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:24,479
Far from theorizing, it is a practical model that is immediately presented.

126
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:28,960
I advise you through real practical experience.

127
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:33,240
Glory be to God, that is why Surat Al-Qasas is a surah.

128
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:37,080
Joseph, peace be upon him, is one of the amazing images called

129
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:41,200
Surah Yusuf, peace be upon him, is a consolation for every sad person.

130
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:45,040
سلوى كل محزون ما في احد عنده مشكله ولا

131
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,800
No sadness, no distress, no worries, it doesn't mean anything

132
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,240
You imagine that it happened in your life, in the story of Joseph

133
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:54,519
Peace be upon him, no one passes by this story

134
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,360
الا ويجد فيها بغيته ويجد فيها الطمانينه

135
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,000
He finds peace and comfort in it.

136
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,640
اجابات كتيره جدا على اسئله كتيره جدا

137
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,360
يمكن يعني مش عايز اضرب امثله دلوقتي عشان

138
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,519
Don't rush until you finish the picture with me, God willing.

139
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,560
الله هتنبهروا قد ايه الصوره دي جاوبت على

140
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:14,920
Every question is on the mind of each one of us. Come on.

141
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:19,680
Let's open up after we get to know the picture

142
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:23,680
And with its beauty we open and say, O Lord, help us and guide us

143
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:27,279
To ponder this beautiful and noble Surah

144
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:30,240
Okay, the surah begins with “In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.”

145
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,040
pain

146
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,640
particle for direct object

147
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:38,720
This blessed Surah begins like many Surahs.

148
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:42,839
Mecca B

149
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:47,360
In the disconnected letters and the disconnected letters are words

150
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:51,720
كتير قوي في الحروف المقطعه لكن يعني اشهر

151
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,720
Two sayings about the disconnected letters

152
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:01,680
The first saying

153
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:05,279
The letters are DATE, each letter represents a word.

154
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:11,760
وده كان قول ابن عباس رضي الله عنه وارضاه

155
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:15,360
He used to say Alif Lam Ra, meaning I am God, I see

156
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,360
I see God

157
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:24,720
And no, God knows best, so I told him that everything

158
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:28,480
A letter that indicates a word. What is the benefit of Ibn Ijtihad?

159
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,760
Abbas, may God be pleased with him and many of the companions

160
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,800
Kabi Bakr, Omar and others were stopping in

161
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:38,160
These letters stop at these letters that

162
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:43,079
القول الثاني واللي اختاره شيخ الاسلام

163
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:47,440
Ibn Taymiyyah, may God have mercy on him, said that these letters

164
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:51,440
But it was brought for a purpose and for a reason, meaning it may not be

165
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,079
It has meaning in itself but there is a greater purpose.

166
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,600
من ورائها ايه الغايه العظيمه اللي من

167
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,519
Behind these letters

168
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,800
Come imagine with me

169
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,560
To whom was this Quran revealed? We revealed it.

170
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,079
Our Quran is in Arabic, right? It was revealed to the Arabs in the first place.

171
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:14,240
It was first revealed to the Arabs and of course it was revealed to the worlds, but...

172
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:17,120
The first thing that came down was the Arabs and the Arabs at the time

173
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,240
They were almost the strongest generation in history.

174
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,000
In Arabic

175
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:26,440
At that time, the Arabs had the strongest craftsmanship.

176
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,639
It is their language

177
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:34,760
Rather, markets were held for the purpose of competition.

178
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:39,560
Poetry and sometimes wars were waged for the sake of

179
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:42,760
بيت شعر وممكن يحصل صلح ببيت شاعر

180
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:46,760
Satire can turn the world upside down, and praise can turn it upside down.

181
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:49,920
The world was their merchandise, the poet and the prose

182
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:55,320
والتنافس في الباب ده رهيبه لدرجه من شده

183
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:59,480
The competition has reached the peak of strength in language.

184
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:04,480
والقاعده بتقول ان صاحب الصنعه تلفته

185
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:07,360
Craftsmanship means if you or you are now one

186
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,000
He understands Arabic very well, he is the best one in

187
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,639
The world is in the Arab world, you are in the transportation

188
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,240
تمام راكب اتوبيس فالناس ده بيتكلم في

189
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,800
الطماطم وده بيتكلم في الخيار وده بيتكلم

190
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,320
In gold, you are not focused anymore. It will be lost in two.

191
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:26,800
بيتكلموا في العربيات هتعمل ايه انت تلاقي

192
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:31,320
What's wrong with you? You traveled all the time. You, for example, A

193
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:33,600
You love makeup a lot, for example, and you are distinguished in it.

194
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,800
الباب ده وفاهمانه قوي فيه وحافظه كل حاجه

195
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,360
فيه انت قعدتي في في ميكروباس ولا بتاع دي

196
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,760
This lady talks about cooking and this one talks about…

197
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,199
I'm not focusing on the kids, I found two

198
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,199
بيتكلموا في الميك اب وماركاته هتلاقي

199
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:51,040
ودانك ايه راعت معاهم على طول صح حتى لما

200
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:53,600
We all entered the same place

201
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,959
هتلاقي بتاع النجف بيبص في النجفه بتاع

202
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,079
Ceramics is looking for ceramics and stuff

203
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:04,480
The sofas are made by the owner

204
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:08,880
Craftsmanship provokes and attracts him, so put yourself in a man's place

205
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:13,600
عربي قح صنعته اللغه مره واحده بيجي له

206
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:16,600
كده واحد بيقول ل را هيعمل ايه؟ ام هيروح

207
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:24,120
Wrap it all around, without thinking about wrapping it around

208
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:24,120
How long is this? What's new? What's this?

209
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,040
ايه عايز تقول ايه يعني ايه ط س م ايوه

210
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,440
What do you want to say? He pulls hard and listens.

211
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,920
اللي جاي وبالتالي هو ده المطلوب ان هو

212
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,920
He hears what is coming and makes sure that this is the Quran

213
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,120
From the All-Wise, All-Knowing

214
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,160
The second need

215
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,839
It is after I drew attention with letters

216
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,079
The section

217
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:50,720
The second wisdom of including the letters is that this is…

218
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:54,000
Challenge, challenge to the Arab man, I say to him

219
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,000
God was sending him an implicit message that the speech

220
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,480
اللي انت هتسمعه ده اللي جاي اللي مش

221
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,399
You will know how to bring something like it

222
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,800
Of the letters you actually speak

223
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:10,560
We did not come with strange letters, but it is the Alif

224
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:14,040
Alif, Lam, Ra, Ta, Seen, and Meem

225
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,320
The Kaff, the Haa, the Yaa, the Ain and the Sad are

226
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:20,519
Your letters are the letters that you make from them

227
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:23,519
The speech is good, this is the speech of the Lord of the Worlds, if you bring

228
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,639
زيه يبقى ده مش كلام رب العالمين

229
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:31,639
طبعا ده تحدي رهيب بالنسبه للرجل عربي

230
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:31,639
بيستفزه جدا انت عارف عامل زي ايه

231
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:38,880
When you want to make someone disabled and you want to show him that

232
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,399
انت ما تعرفش تعمل اللي انا بعمله تروح

233
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,560
اعمل ايه؟ تروح رمي له الادوات قدامه تقول

234
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:47,079
He has tools. Take all the tools. Take my tools too.

235
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,040
Come on, give me the tools and show me how clever you are.

236
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:54,040
You know what to do. You know how to do the same as me.

237
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,959
I'm still talking to you, for example, I don't know

238
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:00,480
You act like me, so you admit that you are incapable of being you

239
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:02,880
It works like him and the higher issue means it is fine

240
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,920
We win the letters, take Alif, Lam, and Ra

241
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,600
And the letters Ta, Seen, and Meem, show me what you will do with them

242
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,600
What are your letters? I did not bring new letters.

243
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,440
الاخر هتسمع دلوقتي بعد الحروف دي كلام مش

244
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:17,079
You will know how to bring something like it, but you will not know how to bring a hadith like it.

245
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:21,279
Never, the challenge is still on. Let them come up with a picture like mine.

246
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:24,480
They come with a hadith like mine and they come with ten fabricated images.

247
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,560
If you do not do it, and you will never do it even if all of humanity gathers together

248
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,000
And the jinn are not able to produce the like of this Qur’an.

249
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,920
They come up with something similar, a challenge that will remain until the Day of Resurrection.

250
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,360
رجل عربي يقدر يجيب زي النص ده يبقى احنا

251
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,519
liars

252
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,560
Ok, of course, if the generation is the first generation

253
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:43,399
The one who is the most skilled generation in the language is unable to remain

254
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,480
باب اولى تضيع وقت ان اللي بعده يحاول لان

255
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:49,199
After him, I will be unable to face this challenge. Do you understand?

256
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,920
The idea

257
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,839
والجيل الاول اعترف كانوا بيعترفوا بينهم

258
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,120
They are not able to bring someone like him, and he told them

259
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:01,519
He says that he has a sweetness that he used to tell them, he says, oh

260
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:05,079
People, by God, I have learned poetry, but it is not poetry

261
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:08,399
And We have taught the eagle, and it is not an eagle, and that it has

262
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:13,639
لحلاوه وان عليه لطلاوه وان اعلاه لمثمر

263
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:17,160
Its bottom is abundant, and it rises high and nothing rises above it.

264
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:19,319
فكان الحروف دي بتخلص موضوع كبير قوي ايه

265
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,759
What do you end the topic with? What do you end the topic with?

266
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:25,920
The Quran is the word of God. Imagine that the matter is over.

267
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:28,319
بالحروف دي الحروف دي خلصت

268
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,120
A very big topic, meaning it should be followed by letters.

269
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:35,120
دي شويه الرجل العربي يسلم ويقر ان ده

270
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,560
The word of the Lord of the Worlds, and the argument against him ends.

271
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,440
It is sufficient for him that We have sent down to you the Book which is recited

272
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,720
Indeed in that is mercy and a reminder for a people who believe.

273
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,279
هم كانوا بيطلبوا الايات فربنا بيقول هو

274
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,920
مش مكفيهم الايه دي طب عديها الاول بعد

275
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:51,319
So let's talk, you didn't pass it, so you didn't

276
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,600
Don't ask for anything new before you send me the verse.

277
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:55,480
وما عدهاش كده كده يبقى انت كده كده

278
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,800
If you are stubborn, then there is no need for me to give you

279
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:01,440
الايات اللي انت بتقترحها فهمنا الفكره

280
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,520
So the second statement is that he believes that the letters

281
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,720
This clip was just meant to get the man's attention.

282
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:10,600
This attracts attention. The second thing

283
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:13,919
لتحدي الرجل العربي واستفزازه علشان يسمع

284
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:17,959
وعشان يظن ان هو يقدر يجيب زيه فيقهر وفي

285
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:20,000
The end means he is convinced that he can never do it.

286
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:23,559
To come with a verse like this? The Quran is this?

287
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,199
سبب في استجابته واسلامه بعد كده هم نفسهم

288
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:28,799
العرب من شده حبهم للغه كانوا بيستخبوا

289
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:32,039
At night, they hear the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him.

290
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,600
وهو بيصلوا بيصلي وكانوا بيقابلوا بعض

291
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:35,960
ويقعدوا يعدبوا بعض يقول له انت ايه اللي

292
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,679
Who brought you here? He says, "Sorry, I couldn't. I'm coming."

293
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,320
Listen to this beautiful Arabic saying to me

294
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,880
Someone comes here to meet him the next day and the third day

295
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:47,000
They meet, it's something very strange. I love the letters.

296
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:50,919
المقطعه اللي هي بتكثر جدا في السور

297
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,600
Mecca in particular and you will find that there is a very clear need that

298
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:59,159
بعد الحروف المقطعه دي على طول بياتي ذكر

299
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:01,200
القران لازم او عاده بص للام بعديها بيجي

300
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:04,720
Because these letters are supposed to end the Quran

301
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,960
With God for the mothers. That is the Book about which there is no doubt.

302
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:13,400
These are the verses of the clear Book. Ta-Sam-Sam. These are the verses of the clear Book.

303
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:16,240
Verses of the clear Book Ha A Mim. By the Book

304
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,200
Download the book from God, the Almighty, the Wise

305
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,000
You will always find this because Date connects me to Date

306
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:26,400
This is a book revealed by God, the Almighty, the Wise.

307
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,400
We understand the brands

308
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:34,440
The clear book told you that is a sign to the distant, right?

309
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,799
I tell you this and that

310
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:41,240
This is a reference to something far away, but the point is that this

311
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:45,320
The Quran is so high, so powerful, so sublime, so powerful that you cannot reach it.

312
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:48,559
You do not know how to answer it completely. It is a precious book. So, may it be high.

313
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:52,360
شان القران عبر عن علو هذا الشان وارتفاعه

314
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:56,880
About the Arabic language, referring to something far away

315
00:18:52,360 --> 00:19:02,480
ايات كل ايه تعتبر داله على وحدانيه الله

316
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:06,039
Understanding the verses, verses, every light, verses, you will enter into it and you will find

317
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:10,480
It confuses you and you find that it indicates the one Lord

318
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:15,039
The Kind, the All-Knowing, the verses of the clear book mean

319
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:18,080
It is not an obscure book, but rather a clear book.

320
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,679
Clearly stated in the beliefs, clear in what it indicates

321
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:24,760
It is clear to him in ethics in transactions in

322
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:27,840
What is clear in the beliefs of God in worship?

323
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:30,760
We want from the servant what is the other article

324
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,760
اخبارها ايه بعد الموت هيحصل ايه كل شيء

325
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:39,240
Clear, no ambiguity

326
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:42,840
There is no clear book in it

327
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:46,960
عشان كده كلمه مبين دي استدل بها اهل

328
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:50,400
The Sunnah is that the origin of the book is that it runs

329
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,640
Words are taken literally

330
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:57,520
This is a great rule.

331
00:19:53,640 --> 00:20:00,679
In it, in the chapter of names and attributes, when our Lord

332
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:06,360
He says about himself that he has a hand or two hands or he has

333
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:09,039
A face or he has such and such qualities, so our Lord said

334
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:12,400
The Book is a clear Book.

335
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:15,240
The clear book is not clear if it is

336
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,200
There is always ambiguity in the words.

337
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,720
The basic principle is that words are interpreted in their apparent meaning.

338
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,919
لان ده من من البيان ليه ربنا يحدثنا

339
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,200
In riddles, he says the hand, but he does not mean the hand, and he says

340
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:30,360
The eye, not the eye, but the face

341
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,120
He means the face and we sit and give her everything

342
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,480
We say that it is not what is meant by its appearance, it is not what is meant by its appearance

343
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:40,760
It is not intended to be apparent without evidence, so how can it be?

344
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:44,840
The Qur’an is a clear book if all the attributes are not

345
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:48,919
مراده على ظاهرها فلا يحب ولا يغضب ولا

346
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:52,320
He laughs, he doesn't come down, he doesn't come back, he has no hand and he doesn't...

347
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:55,559
He has a face if God speaks to us in riddles

348
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,600
This contradicts the fact that it is a book that explains the Book.

349
00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:01,440
The clear meaning is that when an Arab man hears

350
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:04,520
He understands the word immediately, no explanation is needed.

351
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:12,280
The Arab man listens and your Lord came, what will he understand? He came

352
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:12,280
Your Lord came completely when he heard a

353
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:21,720
بل يداه مبسوطتان هيفهم ايه؟ يداه مالهاش

354
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:25,360
معنى عنده المعنى الظاهر كده اذا كان

355
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:28,720
The whole thing was a metaphor and riddles, it wasn't a book

356
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,480
Explaining that the original meaning of words is to be interpreted in accordance with their context.

357
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,919
It seems that unless evidence comes to indicate that

358
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:36,559
المعنى الظاهر غير مراد طالما ما فيش دليل

359
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:40,520
The principle remains that I deal with the apparent meaning

360
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:48,320
These are the verses of the clear Book.

361
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:52,279
Indeed, We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an that you might understand.

362
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,320
We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an. Indeed, We have sent it down. Take now.

363
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:56,159
حته برض في العقيده احنا بص عايزين نطلع

364
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,559
من الصوره دي بكل حاجه يعني كل احلامك

365
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:04,279
We achieve this beautiful Surah. We have revealed it.

366
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:07,679
Our Quran is Arabic, Arabic, oh my God, our Quran is Arabic

367
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:11,000
طب انزلناه دي ان طب ليه ربنا بيقول ان مش

368
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,440
انا اه دي برض حاجه بتلخبط الناس ان ربنا

369
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,720
Sometimes he expresses himself in the plural and sometimes he expresses himself in the singular.

370
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,760
About himself individually

371
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,400
There is no contradiction when God expresses himself

372
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:25,080
In individuals, he wants to explain monotheism, and when he expresses

373
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:28,480
Himself in the plural wants to show greatness because the expression

374
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:31,240
About the individual as a whole is from glorification as what

375
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,520
I say peace be upon you, not upon you, this is a kind of

376
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:38,799
Appreciation for what I say to you is your happiness, not your happiness

377
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,400
This is a kind of appreciation when I tell you that we decided

378
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,880
Alaa Hamed, what do I want to do to pamper myself?

379
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,960
God sometimes talks about himself

380
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,919
Individually, as our master Moses said in a position

381
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:52,279
Monotheism is that I am I, I am God, there is no god but Me

382
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:55,360
Worship me, but sometimes he talks about himself in the plural.

383
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:57,360
To show His greatness, He says, “Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur’an.”

384
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,240
And we will surely protect him. It does not mean that he is talking.

385
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,400
In the plural, it is more than one, but one

386
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,480
He talks about himself in the plural to show the amount

387
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,000
And the glorification is that

388
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:11,440
Anzalnah

389
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:15,279
We sent it down. We sent it down as evidence for the Sunnis.

390
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:18,799
God is above him and God is Most High in the highest and

391
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:22,679
In His essence, glory be to Him, above His throne, above His heavens

392
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:25,520
وانه في العلو سبحانه وتعالى تمام خلافا

393
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:29,240
For the people of innovation, otherwise if he was not in the upper class then why?

394
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:33,000
He says, “We sent it down.” So the sending down of the Book indicates its superiority.

395
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:36,240
God is above His creation and He is distinct from His creation and He is in

396
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,120
Glory be to God Almighty, the Most Gracious, as He said:

397
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,159
العرش ايه استوى والادله كتير بقى اليه

398
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:48,559
The good word ascends, the Book is revealed from God

399
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:52,320
Dear All-Wise, the angels’ ascension is complete.

400
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:55,039
Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High. You who are in the heaven have believed.

401
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,200
That the earth may swallow you up, the subject is long, but this is it.

402
00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:02,720
One of the Sunnis’ proofs of God’s supremacy is me.

403
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:05,880
We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an that you might understand.

404
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:09,960
Perhaps you will understand.

405
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:13,360
If the Qur’an is a call to use the mind

406
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:17,400
Call for the appreciation of reason

407
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:20,919
An invitation to use the mind in its right place because

408
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,520
The Quran is actually full of rational evidence.

409
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:26,200
Rational evidence for monotheism

410
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:29,000
Rational evidence for resurrection

411
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:33,679
The message, as we saw, is a thousand words to the mother.

412
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:37,159
My mind is on the Quran, proof of the message

413
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:39,799
I have lived among you a lifetime before that. Will you not reason?

414
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:43,640
Correct evidence of resurrection

415
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:46,679
For example, He is the One who sends the winds as good tidings before the heavens.

416
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,760
His mercy until, when it has carried heavy clouds, We drive them.

417
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:52,559
To a dead land, so We sent down water into it and brought forth thereby from it

418
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:56,880
All fruits also occupy your mind as well we go out

419
00:24:52,559 --> 00:25:00,600
The dead, so that you may remember completely, is evidence of monotheism.

420
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:04,360
Is he who worries like he who does not create? Will you not be reminded?

421
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:09,080
So you will find a lot of calls to use the mind in

422
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:11,679
Meditation on contemplation on reflection on contemplation

423
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,120
But unfortunately, some people continue to use their minds in the opposite way.

424
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,440
He is required to use reason in judging.

425
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:21,559
النصوص فيقول لك النص ده مش جاي معايا

426
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:24,320
We keep giving it to him, we keep denying it, we keep doubling it, it is not him

427
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:26,760
It is not the role of the mind, the mind. Yes, first we will see if

428
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,039
The Quran is the Quran, no one is looking for anything else

429
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:32,679
If the Quran is a Sunnah, we will occupy the mind with knowledge.

430
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:35,880
The correct and the weak after what remained we knew that this

431
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:39,279
Quran or we know this is an acceptable hadith that will last forever

432
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:42,600
There is no choice but to accept it, accept it, accept the judgment

433
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:44,720
اقبل العقيده واصدقها واعمل بالايه بالحكم

434
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,760
It is not that I will say after that I will enter my mind and say

435
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,720
اصل العقيده دي مش جايه في العقل لا اصل

436
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:53,240
دي مش مقنعه فناولها فنشيلها فنغيرها يبقى

437
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,960
We are here, the mind, because the mind is the original

438
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,320
I should have known that God is capable of everything.

439
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,279
There is no such thing as telling me something is wrong

440
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,760
العقيده مش موافقه للعقل انا مش بقيس على

441
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:04,760
My ability is measured by God's ability and God is measured by

442
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,679
All things are possible

443
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,919
My mind tells me that God is wise, so I am not

444
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:11,880
I will put my mind to the judgments and say I like it and not

445
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:15,000
عاجبني ده جاي من عند الحكيم انت فاهم مش

446
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:18,399
فاهم دي مشكلتك الشخصيه فالعقل ده مش

447
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:22,720
His place is to pass judgments after they have been proven.

448
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:26,799
Or accept the beliefs or reject them after they have been proven, but

449
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:30,159
A call to use reason to prove that the text is a text

450
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:34,960
Then, it is fixed in contemplating and meditating on the text.

451
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:39,080
And being influenced by it, acting upon it, and deriving rulings

452
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:42,600
Indeed, We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an that you might understand.

453
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,600
Then God Almighty said:

454
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:54,000
We are back again, we are for glorification, we are for deficiency

455
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:59,039
To you is the best of stories, in what We have revealed to you.

456
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,840
The Quran, and before that you were among the unaware.

457
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:06,360
We tell you the best stories. Okay, let's talk.

458
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:11,039
On two levels, the stories in general are like the Qur’an in general.

459
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:14,279
The stories of the Quran are the best stories, especially Surat

460
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:17,600
Joseph or the story of Joseph is the best story in the Quran

461
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:19,799
Of course, it is fine, and there are reasons for that. We will tell you about them.

462
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,679
Now, but let's talk about the first...

463
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:28,559
General and then private general

464
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:31,840
Why are the stories of the Qur’an the best stories in general?

465
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:38,279
Why is it better than any other stories, whether stories of people?

466
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:42,320
The distorted book, of course, or the stories of people completely

467
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:45,960
او اي قصص خلاف القصص اللي جايه مع الوحي

468
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:50,720
Let's compare them in some things first.

469
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:52,320
We find the first difference in the stories of the Qur’an

470
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,840
It is characterized by

471
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,960
In short

472
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,039
And do not digress into details that do not have

473
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,360
benefit

474
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:07,320
And human stories

475
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:09,919
There is a terrible, terrible digression into every detail.

476
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:13,000
You can find, for example, a story in the Quran in two lines.

477
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:16,600
If it was turned into a written story or a series, for example.

478
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,640
These two lines will last for 10 episodes, and there will be more talk and discussion.

479
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:22,840
Roses and digressions meet the Quran completely

480
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:25,039
About all the details that are not useful at all

481
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,200
اللي احنا عايزينها

482
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:30,120
لان الغايه مختلفه وليه ليه الفرق الغايه

483
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,120
Different and the purpose of the stories of the Quran is not the purpose of the stories

484
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:36,039
الناس اللي بيكتبوا قصص عايزين ايه عايزين

485
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:39,320
يعملوا يعني حبكه دراميه ويشد الناس ويعمل

486
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:42,120
Attract and work views even if you put details

487
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:45,480
It is not necessary, but in the Quran you will find the story

488
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:48,519
Very brief, two or three lines, we will sit and talk about them

489
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,159
ايام وليالي من عظم الكلام اللي فيها

490
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:55,159
Ignoring details that are not useful

491
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:58,519
Focus on useful, salutary content that

492
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:02,919
يعني يخدم القضيه اللي هنتكلم فيها

493
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:05,960
Number two honesty the difference in honesty God's stories

494
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:09,720
Stories of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, are true and correct.

495
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:13,120
ريب فيه واما قصص الناس فعامته يعني فيه

496
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,960
اكاذيب كتيره جدا جدا وبل ممكن يكون اصل

497
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,600
The story is a lie, meaning sometimes the story is true

498
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,679
It's all a lie, that's the whole story, or we won't say it's a lie

499
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,799
او متالفه يعني تمام واحيانا بيكون اصل

500
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:26,919
The story is true, but you will not find it in any real detail.

501
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:30,039
It just happens for the sake of the plot, as you can see.

502
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:34,480
For example, when they made a series about my friend or...

503
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:37,559
A series about our master Joseph. How many things did they happen?

504
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:41,679
اصلا بس لازم نعمل كده علشان الحبكه

505
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:46,480
The drama is perfect, all of God’s stories are true, there is nothing wrong with them

506
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:49,440
Too much talk, too much, all we got was stories.

507
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,559
People are full of useless details.

508
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,600
Grade three

509
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:59,200
completely

510
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:03,320
The third difference is the mark that the stories focused on first.

511
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:07,600
We find that the stories of God Almighty focused on

512
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:10,799
What improves a servant’s religion and his worldly life is by focusing on

513
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,080
In the story, you focus strongly on the meanings of monotheism.

514
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:16,279
Focus on connecting you to the names and attributes we will find in

515
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:19,840
This story is that your Lord is All-Knowing, All-Wise. Indeed, my Lord is Kind.

516
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:24,320
Whenever He wants, He connects you with anything, in the name of God always.

517
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:27,480
It connects you to the afterlife, completely and without reward.

518
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:31,240
The Hereafter is better for those who believe and fear Allah.

519
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:34,200
He connects you to good deeds, for he is the one who fears God.

520
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:37,600
Be patient, for Allah does not waste the reward of the patient.

521
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:40,559
The benefactors take care of you

522
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:45,039
By the deeds of the heart with the names and attributes in the abode

523
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:50,799
The end of the story is ultimately the unification of God.

524
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:53,360
The afterlife is about deeds

525
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:57,760
The hearts are in it, in the end, the story is targeting

526
00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:01,080
Your heart and aims to give you lessons, sermons and Sunnahs

527
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,000
There was in their stories a lesson for those of understanding.

528
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:07,399
It was a fabricated hadith, but the second story is a hadith.

529
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,080
He often slanders and his goal is

530
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:14,039
Lusts

531
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:20,600
You will find most of the stories revolve around the verse about sex.

532
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:23,440
مخدرات القتل دعاره ا مشاكل زوجيه ثم في

533
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:26,480
النهايه هو انت مش عارف هو عايز يوصل ليه

534
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,919
It is a very, very long tragedy.

535
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:32,480
In the end, in the end, sometimes it's not in your hands

536
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:36,039
The moral is that sometimes it turns out the opposite in the end.

537
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:39,720
The lesson is that you sympathize with evil, for example, or that

538
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:42,919
Evil won in the end, okay? So yes, I am.

539
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:47,559
Where is the lesson? Tell me, for example.

540
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:50,799
I watched the series and your heartfelt actions increased, impossible

541
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:55,080
Tell me, for example, a movie you saw that made you more attached to it.

542
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:58,000
In the afterlife, tell me, for example, a song you heard or

543
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,960
A novel from the low novels I read and it got worse

544
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Attachment to God, love for God and monotheism increased in

545
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,760
قلبك مش هيحصل انما بتزداد معلومات كتير

546
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,880
Strong in prostitution, sex, drugs and how

547
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:15,039
Crimes, north, marital problems and ugliness

548
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:18,840
Marriage, the sweetness of walking north, and the beautiful divorce

549
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,840
هو ده اللي انت بتطلع بيه

550
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:25,200
Why does this tell us?

551
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:31,600
The fourth difference The fourth difference between the stories of the Qur’an

552
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:34,200
And people's stories, we assume that stories other than God's will end.

553
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,880
نهايه سعيده فرضا رغم ان ده مش بيحصل

554
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,279
It will always end with good triumphing over evil.

555
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:43,840
النهايه المثاليه اللي ما بقتش موجوده

556
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:48,480
Now that's fine, come on let's see how we got there

557
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:50,799
Here and how the Quran leads us to the same result

558
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,399
People's stories

559
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,880
اللي بيحصل الاتي عشان اقول لك على مصيبه

560
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:59,639
It happens in people's stories, you don't notice it

561
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:02,159
For example, if we watch a series, let us compare between

562
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:04,440
Series because the series is a story

563
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:10,519
What happens in the series?

564
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:15,240
It happens that we watch 29 episodes, 29 episodes.

565
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:18,760
Drug Crimes Details Details in the murder in

566
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:24,600
Adultery in marital infidelity in corruption

567
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:28,120
In evil in prisons, okay, and then the last episode

568
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:31,360
البطل بيخلص الموضوع في اخر حلقه بيضرب ده

569
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:35,360
ويعمل دوت ويجيب حقه والتاني ده اتسجن وده

570
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:42,360
قتل نفسه وبتاع فنفرح ه وبتاع واتاثرنا

571
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:42,360
Good triumphed over evil, sweet and good

572
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:49,559
Let's take an example of a real series.

573
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:52,279
Legend of Mohamed Ramadan

574
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:54,960
One of his most famous series, I mean it was in...

575
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:58,159
A huge amount of corruption, and in the end, there is actually good.

576
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:01,799
It spread on the street theoretically means

577
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,960
In the last episode, "Good guys" after the series "Mohamed"

578
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:07,799
What happened during Ramadan? They went out with their haircuts.

579
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,560
His and his cattle

580
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:13,760
بالالفاظ اللي قالها بالصياعه اللي حصلت

581
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:17,560
In the whole series, and no one is appearing in the series

582
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,720
Why did he repent because of the last episode?

583
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:24,000
اقول لك بقى ليه عشان دي هتنقلني لروعه

584
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:29,720
The Quran, because people are affected by what...

585
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:35,919
He is exposed to it more, even if the mistake is the other person's

586
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:39,480
He is more affected by what he is exposed to, even if it is a mistake.

587
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:43,839
If I watch 29 episodes of evil and one episode of good, I

588
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:46,000
I will come out with evil, not with good

589
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,800
Understood

590
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
لو انا بتفرج على 29 حلقه مخدرات ودعاره

591
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,879
وخيانات زوجيه وبتاع وك اخر حلقه الخير

592
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,200
I won individually, I will prove that I have memorized

593
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:58,920
I wanted to do betrayals and I saved the drugs

594
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,800
I want to drink it and I memorized the words and I want to say them

595
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:05,040
وده اللي بيحصل الناس بتطلع مسلسلات

596
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,480
With jokes, north, ring, and chains

597
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:11,760
No one knows if he has repented or not.

598
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:14,240
عشان اخر حلقه دي جبله في الانسان جبله في

599
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,280
This human being will lead us to the path of the Qur’an.

600
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:20,680
The beauty of ignoring the details of evil

601
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,480
Focus on the details of goodness

602
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,800
Come on

603
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,800
I will give you an example

604
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:34,599
Surah or story of Moses, peace be upon him

605
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:37,599
How was it mentioned in Surat Al-Qasas? What did God say?

606
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,599
He said

607
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,480
We recite to you, in truth, from the news of Moses and Pharaoh.

608
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,920
People who believe

609
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:53,880
The evil will be explained now. The evil episodes will be explained now.

610
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:57,880
Now it will be said that Pharaoh was on earth and made

611
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:01,160
Its people are sects, one group is weakened and the other is slaughtered.

612
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,480
Their sons and their women are kept ashamed. Indeed, he was of

613
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:08,480
Spoilers, this verse will be deleted if it is made into a series

614
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:11,839
You will take the 29th episode, 29 episodes, details, he was

615
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,240
بيقتلهم ازاي والنسوان كان بياخدهم ازاي

616
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:16,599
How does he torture them?

617
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:19,599
ويغتصبهم ازاي ونقعد بقى 600 حلقه في مشهد

618
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:19,599
rape

619
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:25,160
But the Quran has eliminated all evil in the world. Come on.

620
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,400
I have more to do, one by one

621
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:32,520
And We desired to bestow favor upon those who were oppressed in the land.

622
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:35,599
And We make them leaders and make them inheritors and establish them

623
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:38,119
On the earth, and We showed Pharaoh and Haman and their soldiers.

624
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:42,079
They were not warned, and We revealed to the mother of Moses.

625
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:45,680
A very terrible digression into the details of the terrible good

626
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:49,520
All the good details remained another example in the story

627
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:53,240
Joseph, peace be upon him, and she desired him and he desired her

628
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,760
ده مشهد الشر وبعد كده الخير لولا ان راى

629
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:58,440
Proof of his Lord. Thus do We turn away from him the indecent question.

630
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,599
انه من عبادنا المخلصين المشهد ده لو

631
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:04,520
It will be made into a two-episode series. Here are the details.

632
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:07,480
عملت ازاي ولبست ايه وبصت له وبص مشكله

633
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,240
Stay

634
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,599
ده الفرق

635
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,880
ده الفرق من الفراقات ايضا عشان كده انا

636
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:19,079
What do you get from the Quran? I get it with goodness.

637
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,480
بالمشاهد الخير الكتير قوي اللي انا شفتها

638
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:26,480
One of the differences is the ultimate goal.

639
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:30,200
The goals of the story The goal of the stories of the Qur’an is the heart

640
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:33,160
The righteousness of a person is the righteousness of his religion, the righteousness of his worldly life, and his relationship

641
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:37,520
By God, his relationship with the afterlife is the ultimate story.

642
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:40,440
Earthly desires and sights

643
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,119
Regardless, there are no values ​​or constants left.

644
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:46,160
انما اللي بيجي يجيب مشاهدات هو ده اللي

645
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:48,000
In the past, for example, it was normal for movies to...

646
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,079
اللي بتجيب مشاهدات لما الخير ينتصر على

647
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,560
الشر دلوقتي مابقاش كده خلي بالك دلوقتي

648
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:56,760
People tend to think that evil is better in the end and I sympathize.

649
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,079
معاه يعني هو دي المسلسلثات بتاخذ كده

650
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,760
The issue is based on air, there are no rules

651
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:05,400
There are no values, there are no constants, so I can

652
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,440
I will take you and bring you back as I want

653
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,880
والفرق اللي بعد كده هو في الاثر في

654
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:14,680
النهايه انت شفت افلام كتير ومسلسلات كتير

655
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:17,119
و وحكاوي وقريت قصص كتير قو لي الاثر اللي

656
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,319
You have changed your relationship with God.

657
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,240
The afterlife, the righteousness of your heart, and the righteousness of your religion

658
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:24,920
And your acceptance of worship and tell me the effect of Surah

659
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,480
One of the Quran in the same direction in Salah

660
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:30,560
Your heart, your religion, your relationship with God, and your acceptance of

661
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:35,440
العباده هتعرف ساعتها ان في فرق كبير وان

662
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:40,000
We tell you the best stories

663
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:42,560
I hope you understood something

664
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,400
Ok, let's go into the story of Joseph, peace be upon him.

665
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:50,079
Especially because the story of Joseph is the best story in

666
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:53,440
The best stories, I mean the story of Joseph, is the best story in

667
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:57,119
The Qur’an, without a doubt, contains all its details.

668
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:01,480
Very big, complete story from beginning to end

669
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:05,200
The details are perfect and of course it is a very touching story.

670
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:07,280
بكل المعايير عشان كده البعض يقول لك ايه

671
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,880
يعني البعض ليه تاملات في كلمه احسن ليه

672
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:13,720
Why is the story of Joseph, peace be upon him, the best story?

673
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:17,000
هقول لكم كده كم حاجه يعني

674
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:20,640
مش مش هشرحها يعني بس هقولها لكم من على

675
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:25,960
A way to mention some of the niceties

676
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:28,680
Some of them said that it is the best story because it included

677
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:36,400
Envious and envied

678
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:37,560
And the lover and the beloved, the owner and the owned, the witness and the witnessed.

679
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,079
And Habis

680
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:45,960
And imprisoned

681
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:48,000
And fertility, and sorrow, and joy, and poverty, and wealth, and sleep.

682
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,599
And his vigilance

683
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,880
حلوه مش هقولها تاني عشان اقول لكم واحده

684
00:39:51,599 --> 00:40:01,520
Another one, and some said that it is the best story.

685
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:05,440
Because it included love, envy and separation

686
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,880
And the meeting, patience, and regret

687
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,400
And forgiveness

688
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:16,760
Some said it is the best story because it included

689
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:22,040
On all types of movements from one situation to another

690
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:25,560
From hardship to blessing, from humiliation to glory, and from slavery to slavery

691
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:28,960
To the king and from his division and dispersion to the meeting

692
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:33,359
And harmony, from sadness to happiness, and from drought to

693
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:36,440
Prosperity and from hardship to spaciousness, it is beautiful. By God, I liked it.

694
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:39,520
يعني في حاجات كده بتوقفني

695
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:43,800
I want to tell you, that is, by what we have revealed to you.

696
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:48,000
The Quran God is greater, and you were before it to whomever

697
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:50,480
The heedless, even though you were before that among the heedless.

698
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,880
يعني ايه الغافلين ليه ربنا وصف النبي

699
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,440
May God’s prayers and peace be upon him, if he was one of them

700
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,680
The heedless were described in Surah, and he said, “He found you lost.”

701
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:03,560
فهدى يعني ايه من الغافل يعني ايه كان ضال

702
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,560
May God’s prayers and peace be upon him

703
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:11,520
Heedless

704
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:16,920
That is, God explained it at the end of Surat Ash-Shura, saying:

705
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:20,520
And thus We have inspired in you a spirit of Our command to complete what you have been given.

706
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:24,119
You did not know what the Book and faith were.

707
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:26,880
Do you know what the book and faith mean? I was not

708
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:28,920
You know the details, I mean the Prophet, peace be upon him

709
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,880
Peace be upon you

710
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,400
Word

711
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,240
Negligent means you do not know. Negligent means you do not know.

712
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:41,599
وصلتلكش المعلومه فده مش مش حاجه عيب فيه

713
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:45,720
Meaning, what did you not reach? The word “lost” is the word “lost.”

714
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:48,040
It has two meanings: a stray is one who does not know the truth.

715
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:51,839
He tells you to get lost

716
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:54,400
And the one who turns away from the truth has strayed. So when our Lord describes the Prophet

717
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:58,440
If he was astray, he would still mean the first meaning.

718
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:01,599
He who does not know the truth is not exempt from it

719
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:05,280
The truth is that the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, was not there.

720
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,319
He was completely ignorant of the truth, but he knew some of the truth.

721
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,599
As evidence that he, peace and blessings be upon him, was in

722
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:14,079
Ignorance until he was on monotheism on his way

723
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:17,440
Abraham, peace be upon him, did not prostrate

724
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:20,559
For an idol that did not drink wine, did not listen to music, was not

725
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:24,040
بيذني ما كانش بيعمل افعال الجاهليه فكان

726
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:27,960
He knows in general what remains of the religion of Abraham some

727
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:31,920
The verse has some limited details.

728
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,720
But he didn't have the rest of the details.

729
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,920
Other house details

730
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:39,920
Details of the rituals, how do I fast, and what is it?

731
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:42,839
ايه اللي هيحصل بعد الموت ايه لسه

732
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,599
التفاصيل مش عنده هي دي معنى غافل ما كان

733
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:48,680
He knows the details, even if it was just generalities.

734
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:52,000
He knew it and was committed to it, so he was on monotheism

735
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:55,800
He had good morals in general.

736
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,359
He generally avoided all evils.

737
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,640
He did not do anything forbidden in the pre-Islamic era, but what?

738
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:04,720
He knows the details, but he doesn't know about purification and dry ablution.

739
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:07,720
والغسل يعني في حاجات لسه ما نعرفهاش

740
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,319
I don't know the details of the beliefs in faith in God

741
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,880
The Last Day and the angels in the details

742
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:14,200
I don't know her

743
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,200
This is the meaning

744
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,559
The heedless or the meaning of the one who is astray in his right, peace be upon him

745
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,559
Peace be upon you

746
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:25,119
But he was generally on monotheism and was

747
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:29,960
In general, it is about righteousness, but the details of monotheism

748
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:32,599
The details of the rectitude did not reach us.

749
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:35,520
ثم انتقل بقى بدا بنا الايه جمال مال كله

750
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:39,520
When Joseph said to his father, "God is great," he immediately entered.

751
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:43,400
We built the Surah in the goal when Joseph said to his father

752
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:46,839
Oh my father, I saw ten stars, the sun

753
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:50,920
And the moon saw them prostrating to me. He said, O my son, no.

754
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:55,359
Tell your brothers about your dream and they will plot against you.

755
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:58,480
Satan is a clear enemy to man. Good, we have moved on.

756
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:03,040
You will notice that the Surah

757
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:05,680
ا ذكرت الاول مشهد مشهد واحد بس مشهد واحد

758
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:09,599
بس في علاقه يوسف عليه السلام بيعقوب عليه

759
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:13,160
Peace then began a second beginning from the beginning of his saying

760
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:16,800
There were in Joseph and his brothers signs for the inquirers.

761
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:19,359
خد بالك يعني الاول حصل مشهد كده لمستقل

762
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,280
Completely about the story and then we started the story from

763
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:26,200
The first remained, there were signs in Joseph and his brothers

764
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:29,800
For those asking, when he said, when he said, what is this scene?

765
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:34,359
I will explain this scene to you now. You will discover the scene.

766
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:37,599
This is the story column.

767
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:42,520
The story column and the whole story are built on the scene

768
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:46,520
ده عشان كده ربنا ذكره لوحده وهو باختصار

769
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:49,520
How did Jacob raise Joseph, peace be upon him?

770
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,520
how

771
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,920
Jacob made Joseph, peace be upon him

772
00:44:53,880 --> 00:45:00,200
For the sake of dignity

773
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:04,440
He works, raises, establishes or maintains assets.

774
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:06,280
What is the connection between Joseph, peace be upon him, and the verse?

775
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,599
للعظمه اللي احنا بنشوفها منه عليه

776
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,760
peace.

777
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:14,119
Firstly

778
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:16,559
We notice in the story

779
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:19,359
Joseph, peace be upon him

780
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:24,119
I had a dream.

781
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:28,440
The first person he thought of telling him was his father.

782
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:30,800
This is something very striking. How?

783
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,720
الواحد لما بيفكر في حاله كده او حال اغلب

784
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,800
Young people or most people, me and I, if I saw

785
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,240
I dreamed that I went to tell my father

786
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,599
You tell me it's hard

787
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,599
I don't mean to say "no" to my parents, my parents don't even laugh.

788
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:45,680
مني ومش هيقعد يتكلم معايا و ممكن يسخر

789
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:49,400
مني وممكن يقوللي بقوللك انا مش مش رايق

790
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:52,599
You still need to tell me about your dreams

791
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:55,599
Also, I can't stand you when I'm awake

792
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:55,599
You still have dreams to tell me

793
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,079
So if that means that, then you will tell the dream

794
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:03,119
ليه؟ تقول لي اللي يعني اللي بيحبني اللي

795
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:05,280
اللي هيستحملني اللي هيقبلني واللي

796
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,440
هيصدقني واللي مش هيسخر مني ولا هياخد

797
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,839
Seriously

798
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,760
If Jacob, peace be upon him, had these qualities

799
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:16,760
And Joseph, peace be upon him, dealt with him on

800
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:22,359
انه فيه الصفات ديت اذا ما كانش والد اللي

801
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:25,280
هو اوامر ونواهي و وصرامه وبيتعامل كده

802
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:28,079
Army and Baba, Baba is not affectionate, Baba is not

803
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,119
بيسمعناش بابا ما بيقعدش معانا ما فيش

804
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,960
Dot talk

805
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:37,960
This is Jacob, peace be upon him, extending his hand to Joseph, peace be upon him.

806
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:41,640
Peace is a lot of reassurance, security, love and respect

807
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:45,200
Appreciate, understand, and contain

808
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:48,359
Let Joseph, peace be upon him

809
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:51,359
لما شاف منام اول حد فكر يقول له ابوه

810
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:51,359
father

811
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:58,640
You can't imagine what it means to be the first one to think of

812
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:02,440
فيه ابويا يبقى ابويا ده احلى من صاحبي

813
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:05,160
احسن من صاحبي تمام مش ده انت ممكن تقول

814
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:07,760
Don't tell your friend, or your father, or I will tell you

815
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:12,800
I don't tell my father to be my friend, my father is closer to me

816
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,800
From my friend, and this is just the beginning.

817
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:21,000
The normal personality of Joseph, peace be upon him, is a normal father

818
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:23,839
Understand his educational role

819
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,280
بيدي كل مشاعره وحنانه وقلبه واحتوائه

820
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:28,960
And his affection for the son

821
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:31,960
مش بيتعامل ميري مش بيتعامل اوامر مش

822
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:35,000
He acts like he is in the army

823
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,400
We notice here that they are both sitting alone.

824
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,160
True, as evidenced by the fact that no one has heard of the dream.

825
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:45,880
He told him not to confine his vision to his brothers, even though

826
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:48,000
How many children does the father have? 11, not including Youssef.

827
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:52,440
Peace be upon him

828
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:56,000
He has energy and the capacity to sit with everyone.

829
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:58,200
واحد لوحده الواحد لو عنده 12 عيل ده مش

830
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,400
I tell you, I tell you what, you mean, he meets them

831
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:04,480
He will meet them for lunch, but he will meet them in...

832
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:06,400
He will meet them at the meeting on the trip.

833
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,200
عنديش خلق بقى اقعد مع كل واحد لوحده ده

834
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,319
انا 12 واحد لا ده يعقوب عليه السلام عنده

835
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:15,520
Ready to sit with each one alone

836
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:19,119
ويسمعه ويقعد يحكي معاه حكايه طويله قوي

837
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:24,119
And be patient with him and give him sermons and advice and solve it for him

838
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:25,960
His words and understanding of right and wrong, that's you

839
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:28,960
عارفين ان هو ده اللي احنا مفتقدينه في

840
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,960
Our homes

841
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:37,839
We miss the private session in our homes

842
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:41,400
Between mother and daughter and son, between father and son

843
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:45,599
And the daughter's private session

844
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:48,559
Most of us think that he is fine if I am fine

845
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:50,640
In general, of course, there are bad role models.

846
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:53,079
We will not talk about bad models, but I

847
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,480
He says that even the good examples among us, he remembers

848
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:57,240
نفسه كويس بس لما تيجي تقارن نفسك بيعقوب

849
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,359
Peace be upon him

850
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:03,680
Not yet

851
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:05,359
الام فعلا الكويسه هي اللي بتقعد مع تقفل

852
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,920
The door is closed on her and her daughter and they sit down

853
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:11,359
They chat for an hour and she tells him the details of what happened.

854
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:13,079
At school, she told me and did for me, and she is the mother

855
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:16,599
Picking up

856
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:19,119
عشان تربي تقول لها خد بالك من دي لا ديت

857
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:22,760
No, this is better. No, this is not how you should react here.

858
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:26,559
It would stay like this and you would get reactions from her.

859
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:29,280
So you can get to know her personality more and raise her

860
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,640
The best father is the one who sits with his son and tells him to tell me

861
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,359
حصل ايه والابن نفسه بيجي يقعد مع بابا

862
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:37,319
بامان بابا مش مش هيزعقني مش هيضربني مش

863
00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:39,799
هيهزقني مش هيسخر مني مش هيتنمر عليا مش

864
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:42,839
He is less than me

865
00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:45,119
بيحبني فبقعد احكي له حصل ايه في النادي

866
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:48,000
What happened at the gym and what happened with my friends?

867
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:50,200
وبابا بيحبني قوي بيتلطف معايا بيش بيشكر

868
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,160
فيا الحاجه الحلوه اللي بعملها في في نفس

869
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,760
If time warns me of something, I benefit from it.

870
00:49:52,160 --> 00:50:00,280
قوي من ابويا انا بحب احكي له عشان دايما

871
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:02,160
In my back and my strong friend, my father, the private council

872
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:05,839
Not this year

873
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:08,280
مع كل واحد لوحده عشان اقرا كل واحد لوحده

874
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:11,200
اللي بيعمل كده ده اللي بيربي صح ما

875
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:14,960
بنعملش كده يبقى لسه في لسه قدامنا شويه

876
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,960
Until we reach the right model in education

877
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:27,079
The private council was repeated many times, we saw it in every

878
00:50:24,799 --> 00:50:29,599
Prophets and righteous people

879
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:32,160
A private council between Abraham, peace be upon him

880
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:34,880
واسماعيل عليه السلام وهو بيقول يا بني

881
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:38,440
The same words are: I see in my dream that I

882
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:41,920
I will slaughter you and see what you see

883
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,640
He said, "O my father, do as you are commanded. You will find me, God willing."

884
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,599
God is among the patient

885
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:50,400
Private council between

886
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:55,319
Luqman and his son say, "My son."

887
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:58,440
It is as little as a mustard seed, my son.

888
00:50:55,319 --> 00:51:00,920
Establish prayer, enjoin what is right, and refrain from what is wrong.

889
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:04,440
Friendly base

890
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:08,960
القاعده اللطيفه اللي مش جيش مش اوامر مش

891
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:11,920
Mary is a love base full of containment, love, femininity and beauty

892
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:14,599
Kindness between father and son

893
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:18,240
Then one of the attributes is

894
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:21,319
The session is a matter of sophistication in dealing.

895
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:25,920
الرقي بقى اللي هو ايه خيالي

896
00:51:21,319 --> 00:51:30,680
The son says my father, my son

897
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:34,119
And the father replied to him, saying, “My son, my son, what is it?”

898
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:36,920
They said, "Oh boy, oh girl, you are my beloved."

899
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:40,000
Okay, son

900
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:42,280
الابن مش هيقول يا ابتي غير لما يسمع من

901
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,160
His father says, "My son."

902
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:47,319
Don't ask your son to respect you while you are belittling him.

903
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:50,440
Going and coming

904
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:53,680
Don't ask your son to treat you with respect

905
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:56,960
I curse him with the dirtiest words

906
00:51:53,680 --> 00:52:00,359
At least the mistake of Ibn Toul Nahar is being told.

907
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:03,839
A dog or an animal, and a girl is called a boot or a...

908
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:06,599
غبيه يا حماره وبعد كده الابن تيجي يكلم

909
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:09,280
His father tells him that he has to stop while talking to him.

910
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:11,440
You respect your father, kiss my hand and my head and say

911
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:17,319
Oh, my God, my father.

912
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:22,359
Where are you? You're a mess.

913
00:52:17,319 --> 00:52:25,920
The son is the father's mirror, the daughter is the mother's mirror

914
00:52:22,359 --> 00:52:31,799
When she sees her mother, she says sorry, meaning she is rude

915
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:33,400
She has a long tongue, swears, backbites and slanders.

916
00:52:31,799 --> 00:52:36,359
And the wind

917
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:38,839
كانت بتت لو طلعت شبه امها

918
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:41,160
انت اللي عملت فيه كده ما تطلبيش منها

919
00:52:38,839 --> 00:52:45,440
Look, she is affectionate, kind-hearted, and treats her husband well.

920
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:49,280
كويس ما انت كنت بتعاملي ابوها مش كويس هي

921
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:51,760
She left her mother's house and was bad with her father

922
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:55,359
She did this to her husband, and now her mother is trying to...

923
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:57,559
Fix what's between them, laugh at who she is

924
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:59,960
Mirror for you

925
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:02,640
I want my son to be something, so I should do it first.

926
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:06,319
My son is a blank slate, when he finds the house he will respect it

927
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:09,720
Some of them respect my wife and talk to her in the most beautiful way.

928
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:12,280
I say the most beautiful words to her

929
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:15,799
She sees my middle daughter, for example, she sees me talking

930
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:18,119
How do I talk to my older sister respectfully and politely?

931
00:53:15,799 --> 00:53:20,520
And caress her and kiss her

932
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:23,839
هتطلع عامله ازاي هي ما شافتش غير كده فهي

933
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:27,280
ما تعرفش ان في قله ادب يعني يعني ممكن لو

934
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:29,960
She went to another house and saw the father cursing his son

935
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:33,119
والابن بيشوح لابوه تقول ايه الناس

936
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:36,839
الغريبه دي رغم ان ده ممكن نموذج العادي

937
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:38,960
But she didn't see it like that. She doesn't know anyone but him.

938
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:41,960
Why you, why you guys? Aren't you?

939
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:47,160
بتحترموا ابائكم ليه؟ هو الاب مش بيحترم

940
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:47,160
ولاده ليه؟ هي ما تعرفش الكلام دوت

941
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:54,880
فلن تجد بيتقال فيها ابتي الا البيت اللي

942
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,880
It is said, my son

943
00:53:55,799 --> 00:54:01,359
Note here

944
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:04,119
These

945
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:07,359
يوسف عليه السلام بيحكي فعلا حاجه غريبه

946
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:11,000
It's really strange if my father is not Jacob

947
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,000
Peace be upon him, he took the matter with sarcasm

948
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,160
He could have said an unnecessary word to his son.

949
00:54:14,359 --> 00:54:18,799
وهو بيقول له كده لو بيقول له بقول لك ايه

950
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:21,240
You sit and see me as planets and suns and I tell you

951
00:54:18,799 --> 00:54:24,960
Oh man, go to sleep, you'll hurt me

952
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:27,280
Why is my brain missing you? What should I tell you?

953
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,200
I am not dead, that's it, but what about you?

954
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:33,119
Amal disappointed me, if I talked to you it would only be in my dreams

955
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:35,040
And my ambitions and you break me I tell you, Dad

956
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,280
I wish he would keep telling me, "Son, you will always fail."

957
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,839
You, my son, you have no need for it, and the girl says

958
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:45,280
لي بابا نفسي اعمل وبتاع يا بنت تلهي على

959
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:48,040
You stay home and go to the kitchen

960
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:51,000
How do you want your son to be a human being?

961
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:54,319
As soon as he tells you a story or tells you about a dream

962
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:58,200
His dreams or he tells you one of his goals and he sticks to it

963
00:54:54,319 --> 00:55:00,920
If you shake him, he won't tell you again and you won't know who he is.

964
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:04,480
بيعمل ايه بعد كده وهيكبر وهتبقى انت مش

965
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:08,240
عارف هو فين وخرج فين وج منين وبيشتغل ايه

966
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:12,960
وبي الفلوس دي جايبها منين ولا هيقول لك

967
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:15,920
خلاص كان زمان كان من زمان انت ما اديتنيش

968
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:19,319
I'm safe talking to you anyway

969
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:23,680
You didn't contain me, you were supposed to appreciate what I said

970
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:27,160
Even if I say something stupid, I'm sorry if I say something stupid

971
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:31,160
You could understand what I was saying. I was too young to understand.

972
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:33,200
I'm sorry, I have to

973
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:36,000
when

974
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:38,920
I appreciate my son's words, I appreciate them on his level, not his

975
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,640
My level is that I'm sorry, but my daughter can come

976
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:44,760
You're telling me really pointless things.

977
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:47,480
As for me, I can turn it into a joke, but it's coming

978
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:50,480
She tells me that she is nervous and angry, and I feel that

979
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:52,720
هي واخده الموضوع بجديه ومحموقه وحصل كده

980
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,200
وعملت لي كده وبتاع

981
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:58,480
You have to deal with the level of speech at the level of

982
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:01,400
Her understanding is not at the level of your understanding because she sees

983
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:03,680
The topic is big and I think it is very important

984
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:06,039
Don't you think it's a trivial matter? It really is trivial.

985
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,760
For you and for me, but he is not

986
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:10,559
It was insignificant to him

987
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:13,440
فلو انت قلت لها ان الموضوع ده تافه هي مش

988
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:15,760
Come tell me again

989
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,359
You will know when your children do not come to talk

990
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,720
You need to know that you

991
00:56:18,359 --> 00:56:24,280
I did not give them security

992
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:27,319
I couldn't stand their words, so I called them several times and they hung up.

993
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:31,440
I told you some stupid things several times

994
00:56:27,319 --> 00:56:33,440
It happened to me, sorry, I mean it happens to them in schools

995
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:36,720
كان المفروض رد فعلك ان انت طب ايه اللي

996
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:39,359
It happened, tell me, how did this happen? No, no, no.

997
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:42,319
ما ينفعش ابدا وانت عملتي ايه وتعالي

998
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:44,920
Give me a hug, my love. I mean I appreciate it.

999
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:48,640
قوي الموقف اللي انت اخدتيه وانت صبرتي

1000
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:51,720
كتير واستحملتي كتير مع ان اصلا يعني هوا

1001
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:56,000
But I speak with his mind, not mine

1002
00:56:51,720 --> 00:57:02,039
Your son will come and tell you everything then. He is my father.

1003
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:04,599
ده لما بحكيله بيقدرني بيرفعني فوق و فعلا

1004
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:06,720
He respects my words, he will involuntarily find himself

1005
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:09,200
He wants to tell you

1006
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,960
Sorry, if your son had the same dream

1007
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,880
Joseph, peace be upon him, if you do not know the story of Joseph

1008
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,599
Peace be upon him, you will mock him and say:

1009
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:18,119
Name of the person

1010
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:23,200
دي مشكله احنا مش عارفين نتعامل مع

1011
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:26,160
Our children, yes, containment. It is true that I contain them.

1012
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:29,480
Get down to his level, but that's the bottom line. Get down to his level.

1013
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:31,520
His ideas and deal with the importance of the subject according to

1014
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:34,880
Its importance to him is not its importance to me

1015
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:37,400
انا وادي له وقت ما استخسرش فيه وقت ده

1016
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:40,280
اغلى حاجه عنديش انا مش فاضي انجز في

1017
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:43,079
Speak up, my son. I don't have time for you. Don't talk.

1018
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:46,400
ابني خد راحتك اقعد بقى سيب بقى اللي في

1019
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:50,039
ايدك نقعد ايه اللي حصل واقعد معاه نص

1020
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,839
He talks to me for an hour and I talk to him, raise him and advise him

1021
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:55,240
I will give him my experience. That's it, my son. I'm full.

1022
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:57,280
بابا كفايه كده طب اتوكل على الله لو في

1023
00:57:55,240 --> 00:58:00,480
Another thing, come to me, my heart is open

1024
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:04,599
You have time, my son. Whenever you come, I will come.

1025
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:07,680
صاحبك يعني تخيل ابن ابوه بيعامله كده مش

1026
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:09,960
هيحتاج بقى يضربه مش هيحتاج يهزقه مش

1027
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,920
He needs to tell him, "My son, don't listen to me. Listen to me."

1028
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,880
My son, if his father told him anything

1029
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:17,720
He would have done it to your friend if his mother had told him anything.

1030
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,720
حاجه هيعملها حب بقى يعني اشتغلوا على

1031
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:23,280
Love, guys

1032
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:26,000
Work on love a little

1033
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:30,119
Joseph, peace be upon him, speaks reassuringly in

1034
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,880
A serious topic, of course. He told him that he saw someone

1035
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:35,839
The planets, the sun, and the moon, I showed them prostrating to me.

1036
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:38,640
The religion here is Jacob, peace be upon him, remained a sense

1037
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:43,839
The topic is very, very, very big

1038
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:43,839
First, he understands the vision all the time.

1039
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:50,200
The vision means the most dangerous thing possible.

1040
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,520
What can

1041
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:56,359
And he translated it

1042
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:59,760
It is known that the 11 planets are sisters of the sun.

1043
00:58:56,359 --> 00:59:03,599
The moon, father and mother

1044
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:06,319
بيسجدوا له يعني طبعا السجود هنا سجود

1045
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:09,640
Honoring the angels' prostration to Adam is not prostration

1046
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:11,720
عباده ماينفعش حد يسجد لحد عباده لكن في

1047
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:14,280
The law before us was beneficial to someone who wanted to be honored.

1048
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:17,680
One means to appreciate him or express his respect for him

1049
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:19,480
يسجد له لكن في دنا اتلغى الموضوع ده

1050
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:22,200
The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: If it were

1051
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:25,480
This topic remained. I ordered the woman to prostrate.

1052
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:30,240
لزوجها تقدير واحترام عشان حقه لكن خلاص

1053
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:30,240
مافيش حتى السجود التكريم ده اتلغى عندنا

1054
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:36,039
All

1055
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:39,640
In Joseph, peace be upon him

1056
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:43,559
B is of course he saw and realized the seriousness of the situation

1057
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:46,680
The sun and the moon are very big, of course there is a difference in

1058
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:50,119
The sun and the moon, who is the sun and who is the moon?

1059
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:52,079
So say it, by the way, there are people

1060
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:55,680
They said that the sun is the mother and the moon is the father

1061
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:58,880
And people said that the sun is not the father and the moon is not the father

1062
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:00,760
She is the mother, it is a matter of controversy, even if I am

1063
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:04,680
It means

1064
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:07,160
I feel inclined like this because the father is the sun

1065
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:10,480
Mother is the moon

1066
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:14,440
Why? First, it started with the sun.

1067
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:19,680
والقمر فعاده الاب اللي بيقدم.

1068
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:21,359
Where is the sun shining?

1069
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:24,920
And heat.

1070
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:27,520
The moon is just shining

1071
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:30,280
والاب هو اللي بيبقى فيه اضاءه وحراره لان

1072
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:33,079
The father has the light, meaning he has it.

1073
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:35,799
المشاعر والتربيه وكل حاجه وفي الحزم

1074
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:40,559
والشده اللي هي الحراره

1075
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:43,440
في عنده سلاح ثاني والام عاده بيغلب عليها

1076
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:46,520
Lighting, but kindness, mercy and severity

1077
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:50,480
فيها بتبقى اقل شويه

1078
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:53,960
So, the interpretation of the sun as the father is closer to a meeting.

1079
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:56,640
Lighting with heat and the interpretation of the mother with the moon

1080
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:59,799
It is closer to being less lit and warm or what

1081
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:02,880
Fish heat

1082
01:00:59,799 --> 01:01:07,799
Another benefit if we say that the sun is the father

1083
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:12,559
The moon's light is always a reflection of the sun, right?

1084
01:01:07,799 --> 01:01:18,760
Also the father is the pillar of the house

1085
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:23,599
لو نور البيت كله ينور والام تنور تمام

1086
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:26,680
The father really, really, really can make it.

1087
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:29,920
Mother makes the house happy and can ruin it

1088
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:34,079
All of them, meaning the more enlightened the father was.

1089
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:36,760
The mother is more enlightened and the mother's response remains a reaction

1090
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,640
So, guys, we remember the responsibility of the father. The father is important.

1091
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:41,680
Very much so

1092
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:43,480
He said, “By the sun and the moon, you saw them prostrating to me first.”

1093
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:46,559
need

1094
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:50,359
The first prevention of corruption

1095
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:55,039
Preventing corruption He said, O my son, do not tell your dream to

1096
01:01:50,359 --> 01:01:58,480
Your brothers, you are sure that Satan is plotting against man.

1097
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,480
A clear enemy

1098
01:01:59,279 --> 01:02:05,160
Let's first talk about vision and its types.

1099
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:07,240
بسرعه كل رؤيه ممكن اعمل معاها ايه الرؤيه

1100
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:10,079
On three types or what a person sees in

1101
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:13,520
Dreams are of three types

1102
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,520
The first type

1103
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:19,640
هي رؤيه الحق اللي هي من الله وعاده دي

1104
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:24,599
بتكون رؤيه واضحه جدا تفاصيلها واضحه

1105
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:31,960
ومنطقيه تمام وبيبقى فيها سكينه وطمانينه

1106
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:31,960
Fadi, this is a true vision. If it is really a vision from God

1107
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:37,480
I think I saw something good or something

1108
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:40,119
حاجه شر

1109
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:42,599
لو شفت حاجه خير اعمل ايه النبي عليه

1110
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:46,039
Peace and blessings be upon him. He said: If one of you sees what he likes

1111
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:48,920
Only those who love him should tell it, just like our master Jacob.

1112
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:51,720
He says to Joseph, peace be upon him

1113
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:54,720
If one of you sees something he likes, he should not tell anyone about it except those he loves.

1114
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,720
loves

1115
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:00,720
Because of envy, if one of you sees something he dislikes

1116
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:09,200
He said: No one should be buried in it. No one should be buried in it.

1117
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:12,400
Never, you neither love him nor do you like him. Forget that you

1118
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:14,440
شفتها ده الحل واوصى عليه الصلاه والسلام

1119
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:18,480
اللي شاف حاجه بيكرهها كذا وصيه قال لا

1120
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:21,559
Someone tells him to turn to the other side.

1121
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:25,680
If I am still in bed, I will change my clothes and sleep on them

1122
01:03:21,559 --> 01:03:27,880
My other side said: And let him who seeks refuge seek refuge in God

1123
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:32,720
I seek refuge in Allah from the evil of this.

1124
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:36,880
The vision is moving to his left three

1125
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:39,720
No one talks about it or asks for its interpretation ever.

1126
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:45,240
Because one of the reasons for getting

1127
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:47,400
The vision has its interpretation. If it is interpreted, it will happen.

1128
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:49,960
فطالما اي حاجه انت مش عاجبها مش حاببها

1129
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:54,880
Don't ask about its interpretation. Some people ask about it.

1130
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:57,559
اي منام بيشوفه منام مش حلو ما تحكوش لحد

1131
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:00,400
I seek refuge in God from his evil. A child on your left three times.

1132
01:03:57,559 --> 01:04:01,960
Forget about your sleep, forget about it completely, as if it were you

1133
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,880
I saw him

1134
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:09,240
Okay, so the second type of vision remains...

1135
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:11,119
حاجه بتشوفها بس هي من الشيطان

1136
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:15,520
ودي في الغالب بتبقى حاجه مش مفهومه

1137
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:19,119
ملخبطه كده ومحزنه ومالهاش مالهاش ملامح

1138
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:21,559
You don't know how to say it well, but it's annoying

1139
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:23,359
احيانا الثالثه اللي هي بتبقى حديث نفس

1140
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:26,240
يعني واحد عنده امتحان بكره نام حلم

1141
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:28,559
بالامتحان دي مالهاش تفسير واحده بكره

1142
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:31,920
فرحها نامت حلمت بفستان الفرح وبجوزها

1143
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:34,839
مالهاش تفسير واحد عنده عمليه بكره نام

1144
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:38,480
حلم بالدكتور والعمليه مالهاش تفسير لان

1145
01:04:34,839 --> 01:04:42,079
This is a conversation that anyone who is busy with something else would have.

1146
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:45,359
What will he find himself doing? What will he find himself thinking about?

1147
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:47,599
لوحده فهمنا طيب عشان كده بقى سيدنا يعقوب

1148
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:51,799
Peace be upon him, he said to him, “Do not tell your dream to anyone.”

1149
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:55,200
Your brothers are plotting against you. There is no benefit here.

1150
01:04:51,799 --> 01:04:55,200
The first benefit

1151
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:03,720
It is our master Jacob

1152
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:03,720
He knows his children well

1153
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:13,400
He knows his children very well, which is proof that he cares.

1154
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:15,480
بيهم كلهم خلي بالكم بس طبعا يوسف عليه

1155
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:18,359
السلام هو بيقبل عليه اكتر فاكيد اللي

1156
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:20,920
He is more accepted and gets more attention.

1157
01:05:18,359 --> 01:05:26,440
لكن هو مهتم بيهم كلهم مش معنى ان ولاده

1158
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:26,440
مش مش احسن حاجه دلوقتي ان هو مهملهم

1159
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:35,640
هو مهتم بيه ومركز معاهم كلهم وبيديهم

1160
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:38,960
I care about them all, as I know their personalities well.

1161
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:42,160
He told him not to be mean to his sisters, or he would plot against him.

1162
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:44,640
كيدا عارف دماغهم كويس جدا وعارف بيفكروا

1163
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:48,440
في ايه كمان

1164
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:52,720
الحاجه اللي بعد كده نتعلم من يعقوب عليه

1165
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:56,839
Peace be upon you, if I knew that there was an evil person or

1166
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:59,079
He envies me or plots against me, so it is in my best interest

1167
01:05:56,839 --> 01:06:01,680
Hide from him

1168
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:05,400
الخير اللي عندي ما استطعت ما في حاجات ما

1169
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:09,400
اعرفش اخفيها في حاجات هي طبيعتها الظهور

1170
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:12,720
But I can hide everything from him of blessings

1171
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:15,720
Hide it as much as possible as much as possible without

1172
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:20,640
I feel sorry for myself, but I don't want to tell him in the first place

1173
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:23,880
من نفسي كده فمن الرحمه بيه لان النفوس مش

1174
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:28,440
Salma, he might be jealous of me

1175
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:31,599
So and so, of course the worst thing is that you publish it

1176
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:35,240
All the good things happen to you on the media because the media

1177
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:37,920
Do not discriminate, reach all people, and share

1178
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:40,319
فضلا عن الناس اللي بتشوفك في كل اتجاه

1179
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,119
فانت بيشوفك اللي بيحبك واللي بيكرهك

1180
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:45,240
واللي عايز لك الخير واللي عايز لك الشر

1181
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:48,119
واللي بيحسدك واللي بيدعي لك عشان كده يا

1182
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:51,039
One of the stupidest things is that we keep publishing

1183
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:53,359
All our sweet things are on the internet, and I wish we could.

1184
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:56,359
بننشر الوحش معاها عشان نقول للناس احنا

1185
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:59,279
عندنا وحش برده لا ننشر حلو بس فطبعا

1186
01:06:56,359 --> 01:07:02,839
The second one is that you don't live in a kingdom

1187
01:06:59,279 --> 01:07:06,039
Nothing bad is happening to you, so come on now

1188
01:07:02,839 --> 01:07:08,720
You have three eyes, come on, lie down in bed now

1189
01:07:06,039 --> 01:07:12,599
Don't post anything, guys. I want to tell you.

1190
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:16,839
Tell your loved one what you will tell him on the media

1191
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:19,039
هتوصل اللي بتحبه بس هتوصل بكوكب كله يبقى

1192
01:07:16,839 --> 01:07:24,200
الكلام ده يتقال كده بيني وبينك فيس تو

1193
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:24,200
Vest in front of you, not on the media

1194
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:32,119
He told him

1195
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:34,119
He is plotting against you

1196
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:37,960
وبعد كده عشان يوسف عليه السلام ما يكرهش

1197
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:42,200
What are his sisters, considering that his sisters are

1198
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:45,720
بشر والبشر حتى لو كان مش صالح دلوقتي قد

1199
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,720
He is getting better

1200
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:50,839
He may get better

1201
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:57,440
The bad person is a victim of a devil who seduced him.

1202
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:04,240
He is also guilty, but our master Jacob transferred him to

1203
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:06,520
The enmity of Satan himself remained, they transferred it to a higher transfer

1204
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:08,599
As if he wanted to tell him that they are your sisters and not them

1205
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:11,559
Your real enemies because they might be tomorrow

1206
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:14,119
They changed, your real enemy, my son, is

1207
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:18,799
The devil wants you to focus on your enemy, focus on him

1208
01:08:14,119 --> 01:08:22,159
The devil, because tomorrow God may guide your sisters

1209
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:26,000
وهو حس المعنى ده من الرؤيه ما هم هيسجدوا

1210
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:29,560
For Youssef, how if they envy him, then of course as long as

1211
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:32,279
If they prostrate to him, then they are satisfied with him, then he will be reconciled.

1212
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:34,040
Their condition is such that he does not want to create enemies among them.

1213
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:37,000
His sisters and he says to him, your sisters are a monster, where is that?

1214
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:40,799
Mothers fall between their children

1215
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:43,480
ده في عيله بيوقعوا بين بعض ده يعقوب عليه

1216
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:46,120
Peace be upon you, Lord of my son, may your heart remain perfect with you.

1217
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:49,199
Your sisters, your problem is with the devil.

1218
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:51,600
للانسان عدو مبين عشان كده كان سهل على

1219
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:53,319
Youssef forgives his sisters and in the end he said no leaks

1220
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,520
Today my problem is that I was not with you

1221
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:59,319
زمان ويوسف عليه السلام عبر عن الموضوع ده

1222
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:02,920
At the end of the story, when he said after he had been tempted

1223
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:06,120
The devil is between me and my brothers. My Lord is kind to me.

1224
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:08,920
يشاء سبحان الله تربيه عجيبه فاذا اول

1225
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:11,640
Something that Jacob connected to Joseph, peace be upon him

1226
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:14,199
Satan's enmity

1227
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:19,000
ودي خلاصه التربيه اللي جايه بقى هو اصلا

1228
01:09:14,199 --> 01:09:21,319
There are only two things: the enmity of Satan and the love of the Most Merciful.

1229
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,239
يوسف عليه السلام كل الابداع اللي عمله في

1230
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:28,440
The story is a result of these two origins, that he was raised

1231
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:30,640
On the enmity of Satan and the love of the Most Merciful, he led to enmity

1232
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:34,960
The devil is here, come on, the love of the Most Gracious has come

1233
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:37,000
How did he begin to love him for the sake of God in two ways? First:

1234
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:40,960
Mention of livestock

1235
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:43,120
Mentioning the attributes, or we can call it mentioning the benefit

1236
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:48,159
المتعدي اللي هو النفع اللي بيجي لك من

1237
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:48,159
Our Lord and the mention of the attributes of our Lord

1238
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,679
Because anyone or anything that loves in the world loves

1239
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:58,080
الحاجتين هم ما فيش غيرهم هم نفس الحاجتين

1240
01:09:54,679 --> 01:10:00,159
Countries either for his own qualities or for his qualities

1241
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:02,239
Transgressive

1242
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:06,159
So now he will tell him that God chose you

1243
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:08,120
Transitive adjective: “an” “an” “da na’im” “in’am” is transitive but

1244
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:12,040
I tell him that your Lord is All-Knowing and All-Wise. This is a quality.

1245
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:15,320
Self in God, but anyone who knows that we love anyone

1246
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:17,560
Hakim Beithab, let me give you an example so you will understand now.

1247
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:21,560
اللي جاي وانا هحاول اختصر عشان ما اطولش

1248
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:23,480
You have five more minutes

1249
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:26,719
You now

1250
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:30,880
بتحب الورده ليه تقول لي عشان شكلها حلو

1251
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:35,000
Well, I benefited from something, but it looks nice.

1252
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:41,480
You can like a picture on your mobile phone so I can't smell it

1253
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:45,199
If she looks pretty, she deserves to be loved. What about you?

1254
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:48,840
الشارع عندكم واحد ربنا رزقه ببيبي كده

1255
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:48,840
Beautiful boy

1256
01:10:52,520 --> 01:11:00,080
The boy is so beautiful and his cheeks are so red

1257
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:00,920
وبتاع فانت اول ما شفته حبيته ليه عشان

1258
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:04,480
His affairs

1259
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:07,080
His cheeks are puffy and red. Okay, so who are you?

1260
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:11,840
استفدت حاجه كده لا حبيته ليه عشان هو

1261
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:14,760
امور طيب بعد كده الولد دوت كبر وبقى ذكي

1262
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:18,719
It turned out that he is smart, I liked him more, but I benefited

1263
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:21,199
حاجه لا بس هو يتحبى عشان هو ذكي يبقى دي

1264
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:23,800
صفه ذاتيه فيه الولد كبر بعد كده بقى اشطر

1265
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:26,679
One of the most polite people I liked at school

1266
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:28,400
The person who completed the Quran the most, who was most dutiful to his parents

1267
01:11:26,679 --> 01:11:31,480
I loved it more, but I haven't benefited from it yet.

1268
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:34,280
He just needs to have good qualities, so he can be loved for that.

1269
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:37,320
صفاته الحلوه طب كبر قوي وبقى صاحب شركه

1270
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:39,719
The oldest and richest man in the area, I loved him more

1271
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:42,560
I have not come across anything until now.

1272
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:46,360
Days passed and I became poor and a man came to me and said to me

1273
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:49,840
Oh man, you have always been a man who loves me. Take it.

1274
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:53,120
He paid my debts and repaid all my debts. It will happen.

1275
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:55,840
ايه بقى اوف المحبه هتضرب فوق قوي لان هنا

1276
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:58,840
He began to move from just not just his personal qualities

1277
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:02,040
There is still a benefit that I get from him. Imagine if it was every day.

1278
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:04,679
Give me the same amount

1279
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:08,360
Okay, imagine if he stood by me a lot

1280
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:12,440
تخيل شغلني او شغل ولادي او او ابنه اتجوز

1281
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:17,199
My daughter, you are our honor

1282
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:20,239
He started to come to me from him, yes, I love him so much, oh, love

1283
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:22,920
رهيب طب ينفع في يوم من الايام اعصيه ده

1284
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:24,880
لو قال لي اي حاجه هعملها اي حاجه حلال مش

1285
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:26,719
ممكن ابدا راجل مش ممكن يا جماعه ده راجل

1286
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:29,280
محترم وبتاع ده لو ما بيعملش معايا حاجه

1287
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:31,360
This is a shroud, I am embarrassed by it, he is a respectable man

1288
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:33,480
ده امال بقى لما قلت لك عمل معايا ايه

1289
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:37,920
ماقدرش اعصي عشان كده هتلاقي سيدنا يوسف

1290
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:42,679
The length of the story is fixed and does not change. He said, God forbid, that

1291
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:45,760
ربي ايه احسن مسواي صح جبل ما وقعش في اي

1292
01:12:42,679 --> 01:12:49,159
A sin that loves our Lord, he is strong and calls to God in

1293
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:51,960
Prison, even though he is in prison, he says, “Oh, that’s who”

1294
01:12:49,159 --> 01:12:54,480
God's grace upon us and upon people, but more

1295
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:57,080
People do not thank God and call to Him

1296
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:59,440
the prison

1297
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:01,880
ليه عشان يتربي على المحبه طب يعقوب عليه

1298
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:05,880
السلام اصل المحبه دي فين؟ بنفس الفكرتين

1299
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:08,719
Countries that talk about the inherent attributes and qualities of our Lord

1300
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:12,520
Or his benefit to Joseph, peace be upon him, so he remained

1301
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:17,520
So what does he say to him? And thus your Lord chooses you.

1302
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:17,520
Your Lord chooses you, that is, He selects and selects you.

1303
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:23,840
And he knew that this was a choice

1304
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:29,360
And if he is chosen for prophethood, they also said that he will choose you.

1305
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:29,360
Your Lord chooses you and teaches you

1306
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:37,000
They didn't say, my son, I'm the one who taught you. Be careful.

1307
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:37,000
Jacob is a terrible role model, honestly.

1308
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:40,719
They didn't say, "My son, I'm the one who taught you," even though...

1309
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:43,480
هو اللي معلمه فعلا هو المعلم بتاعه هو

1310
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:46,600
His sheikh is his teacher, his mentor. They said to him, “My son.”

1311
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:49,080
You saw my upbringing. What do you think of my upbringing? I raised you.

1312
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:52,239
My son, the flesh of your shoulder is from the goodness of the good father

1313
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:54,239
A good father would not do this to his children.

1314
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:57,480
بالله يقول لهم ربنا اللي بيعلمني

1315
01:13:54,239 --> 01:14:01,360
وبيعلمكم ربنا اللي بيعطيني وبيعطيكم

1316
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:04,360
يربط ولاده بالله عشان يحبوا ربنا عشان ما

1317
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:06,920
يعصهوش بعد كده عشان يقدر يسيبهم وهو مطمن

1318
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:11,400
حتى في الخلوات مش هيعصى ربنا لان انا لو

1319
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:13,480
He tied me to him, he will appreciate me while I am here, but I was absent

1320
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:17,560
هيعمل اللي هو عايزه

1321
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:19,719
فهمت حاجه دي مشكله ولادنا قدامنا ملايكه

1322
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:23,360
In front of us are angels saying, “This son is well-mannered, this son is not…”

1323
01:14:19,719 --> 01:14:26,080
He would never do that, my dear daughter. Your son is in...

1324
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:28,400
The school is full of children

1325
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:30,520
You say, my son, my son, this is a very strong matter

1326
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:34,239
بيعملش حاجه ما هو قدامك ما بيعملش حاجه

1327
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:36,199
Because you raised him to appreciate you

1328
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:39,440
مش مصدقه انه بيشتم مش مصدقه ان هو بيعمل

1329
01:14:36,199 --> 01:14:42,639
عاده سيئه مش مصدقه انه بيشرب

1330
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:46,360
احنا ما ربيناش فيه حب ربنا

1331
01:14:42,639 --> 01:14:49,080
Fear of our Lord in the unseen

1332
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:52,760
He says to him, your Lord wants you, your Lord says to him, your Lord does not want you.

1333
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:57,920
قالوش ربنا حتى ربك وكانه بيعمل علاقه

1334
01:14:52,760 --> 01:15:00,719
خاصه بين يوسف وبين وبين بين ربنا ويعلمك

1335
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:02,760
God of interpretation

1336
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:06,719
Hadiths

1337
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:09,480
And may His blessings be upon you, and may His blessings be very great.

1338
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:12,040
He tells him that you will reach the fullness of this blessing.

1339
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:16,440
If a person had only 100 blessings, he would have complete hopes.

1340
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:19,639
The blessing is fulfilled because he realized that he would attain prophethood.

1341
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:22,920
Because this is the highest blessing. There are degrees of blessings.

1342
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:26,159
For example, I, Alaa, am a Muslim. It is a blessing that I am.

1343
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:28,840
A converted Muslim is a great blessing that I am

1344
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:31,199
It is a great blessing to be among God’s saints.

1345
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:33,560
قوي قوي اوصل للنبوه طبعا ما فيش حد بيوصل

1346
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:38,760
النبوه خلاص ان واحد يوصل للنبوه ده اعلى

1347
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:40,320
Something left and may His blessings be upon you and upon the family of Jacob

1348
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,679
كان بيقول له انت النعمه مش عليك انت بس

1349
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,560
This is a blessing for you, your father, your grandfather and

1350
01:15:42,679 --> 01:15:49,360
Your grandfather

1351
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:53,199
Perfect, and upon the family of Jacob, as he completed it, he completed it upon

1352
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:56,719
Your parents before him were Abraham and Isaac

1353
01:15:53,199 --> 01:16:00,639
It's like all the blessings, guys. What a blessing for the father.

1354
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:03,639
A blessing for the son is a blessing for the grandfather, a blessing for the grandson.

1355
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:07,120
When my grandfather becomes a good man, I benefit.

1356
01:16:03,639 --> 01:16:10,280
When my grandfather was rich, I benefited from what I heard from my grandfather.

1357
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:11,840
It's nice that I benefited, because every blessing from the father is a blessing

1358
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:15,280
Every blessing is upon the son, every blessing is upon the grandfather

1359
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:18,760
Son, see that God has blessed you with many blessings

1360
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:21,480
May God bless you and the family of Jacob.

1361
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:23,800
You completed your fathers before you, Abraham and Isaac.

1362
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:27,120
And thus they linked two of the names

1363
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:28,679
Your Lord is All-Knowing and All-Wise. Why did He choose All-Knowing and All-Wise?

1364
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,000
very

1365
01:16:28,679 --> 01:16:32,800
خليني ارجع الاول لفايده وبعد كده اجي هنا

1366
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:36,400
End

1367
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:40,120
He said to him: And so He will choose you.

1368
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:44,400
Jacob, peace be upon him, understood the Sunnah

1369
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:48,639
Choosing only comes after another trial.

1370
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:53,199
Write it, Jacob, peace be upon him, understood the Sunnah

1371
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:58,239
Choosing only comes after a trial

1372
01:16:53,199 --> 01:17:01,239
If God is in conflict, trials will come upon you.

1373
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:05,040
So prepare and welcome it well

1374
01:17:01,239 --> 01:17:08,639
And it was said to Imam Al-Shafi’i: Which of the two do you prefer?

1375
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:11,960
Can a man be afflicted? He said: It is not possible until

1376
01:17:08,639 --> 01:17:14,600
He is afflicted, he cannot be afflicted until he is afflicted

1377
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:16,400
He understood that there would be trials and that Joseph was against them.

1378
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:20,320
Peace be upon him, he will see very severe trials in his life.

1379
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:20,320
عشان يوصل المنزله ديت

1380
01:17:20,639 --> 01:17:23,639
enough

1381
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:34,480
It is possible when trials happen

1382
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:39,440
هيسال يوسف نفسه ليه بيحصل معاه كده فتكون

1383
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:39,440
The answer is that your Lord is All-Knowing and All-Wise.

1384
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:45,040
And another thing, when the affliction happens, it will disappear.

1385
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:48,440
The answer will be that your Lord is wise over him.

1386
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:50,880
He is chosen and selected and leads to prophethood

1387
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:53,920
He might ask his sisters the same question.

1388
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:58,480
اشمعنى انا مش واحداني من اخواتي هي اللي

1389
01:17:53,920 --> 01:18:02,400
If I were you, the answer would be the same: Your Lord is All-Knowing.

1390
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:04,080
حكيم بس ودي اجابه بتريحك في حاجات كتيره

1391
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:06,679
very

1392
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:10,320
When our master Noah asked our Lord, he said, “My son is from…”

1393
01:18:06,679 --> 01:18:12,400
My family, your promise is true and you are the best of judges

1394
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:16,080
He said, "O Noah, he is not of your family. He has done something unlawful."

1395
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:18,840
Saleh, do not ask me what you do not know.

1396
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:21,480
I advise you not to be among the ignorant

1397
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:27,440
ففي حاجات كتير قوي ما عندناش بيها علم بس

1398
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:27,440
This answer is enough for us, your Lord is All-Knowing and All-Wise.

1399
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:34,360
In Joseph, peace be upon him, he was raised with a strong upbringing.

1400
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:36,800
عداوه الشيطان محبه الرحمن دي اللي صنعت

1401
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:40,199
Joseph, peace be upon him, wanted to know this craft.

1402
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:43,080
When did it appear? Why did it appear in every scene?

1403
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:45,520
He was in prison and he made the prisoners love God

1404
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:49,080
رغم ان هو في السجن ممكن يقول ده ربنا

1405
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:51,800
اللي عمل فيا كده وبتاع ما شافش كده شاف

1406
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:55,520
Your Lord is All-Knowing, All-Wise, and He sees that this is good, God willing.

1407
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:58,040
God is our Lord, and He says that this is from the grace of God.

1408
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:02,520
On us and on the people and the masters of the dispersed say

1409
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:06,600
Is it better for God, the One, the Almighty, to resist his desire?

1410
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:09,120
النساء اللي هي محبوبه لاي راجل بحبه لله

1411
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:12,600
God forbid that my Lord is better than me. He said, “Lord of prison.”

1412
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:16,199
I love what they invite me to. Come to me and stay in

1413
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:18,920
The end of the story and see the terrible effect of raising Jacob

1414
01:19:16,199 --> 01:19:22,120
Ali Youssef, although the meeting that took place between

1415
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:25,480
Jacob Jacob Joseph in the end it was after 40 years

1416
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:27,800
He said, "My father, look, this is an interpretation of upbringing."

1417
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:31,000
My dream ten years ago, 40 years later, for the first time

1418
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:33,199
He has been a member of the council for 40 years, but not now.

1419
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,360
ناسي ولا كلمه من اللي حصلت في القاعده

1420
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:37,920
الوديه دي عشان بقول لك المجلس الخاص مع

1421
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:39,960
اولادنا هو ده اللي بيثبت لكن الكلام

1422
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:42,520
The year is forgotten

1423
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:45,199
He said this is the interpretation of a vision from before that he made it clear.

1424
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:48,480
Who made it, my Lord? What did your Lord tell him? So he says:

1425
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:51,120
Here is my Lord, truly, and He has treated me well, as He was raised on.

1426
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:53,480
The selection remained and the choice was better for him when he brought me out

1427
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:56,239
From prison, he did not say, "Put me in prison, I will be polite with you."

1428
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:58,800
God brought me out of prison and brought you from

1429
01:19:56,239 --> 01:20:02,159
البدو وبعد كده التربيه الثانيه من بعد ان

1430
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:05,960
Satan has stirred up trouble between me and my brothers. Indeed, my Lord is Kind.

1431
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:09,719
Whenever He wills, He is the sign. He is the sign. He is the sign.

1432
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:13,480
The All-Knowing, the All-Wise, my Lord, You have given me sovereignty

1433
01:20:09,719 --> 01:20:18,000
And you taught me from what he teaches you, and you taught me from interpretation.

1434
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:18,960
Hadiths and verses only

1435
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,400
In short

1436
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:26,920
The first episode: How Joseph, peace be upon him, was made

1437
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:29,320
Educational and doctrinal benefits of faith. I ask God for them.

1438
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:31,080
If we have achieved the intended purpose

1439
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:34,080
Verses date, God willing we will meet again

1440
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:35,920
The coming is good, may God benefit us and you, and may we hear

1441
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:39,679
Glory be to You, O God, our Lord, and praise be to You. I bear witness that there is no god

1442
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,679
You asked forgiveness, may peace and mercy be upon you.
