Firstly

779
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:16,559
Joseph, peace be upon him
We notice in the story

780
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:19,359
I had a dream.
Joseph, peace be upon him

781
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:24,119
The first person he thought of telling him was his father.
I had a dream.

782
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:28,440
This is something very striking. How?
The first person he thought of telling him was his father.

783

الواحد لما بيفكر في حاله كده او حال اغلب
This is something very striking. How?

784
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,720
Young people or most people, me and I, if I saw
الواحد لما بيفكر في حاله كده او حال اغلب

785
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,800
I dreamed that I went to tell my father
Young people or most people, me and I, if I saw

786
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,240
You tell me it's hard
I dreamed that I went to tell my father

787
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,599
I don't mean to say "no" to my parents, my parents don't even laugh.
You tell me it's hard

788
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:43,599

مني ومش هيقعد يتكلم معايا و ممكن يسخر

790
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,400
You still need to tell me about your dreams
مني وممكن يقوللي بقوللك انا مش مش رايق

791
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,599
Also, I can't stand you when I'm awake
You still need to tell me about your dreams

You still have dreams to tell me
Also, I can't stand you when I'm awake

793
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,960

00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,079
ليه؟ تقول لي اللي يعني اللي بيحبني اللي
So if that means that, then you will tell the dream

اللي هيستحملني اللي هيقبلني واللي
ليه؟ تقول لي اللي يعني اللي بيحبني اللي
